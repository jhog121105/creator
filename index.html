			<p >This menudo is made better, meatier with the simple swap from pork to
			beef This classic menudo just became better with the simple swap of beef. 
			</p>
			
			<p>It's still just as delicious with a different kind of meatiness! 
			This traditional pork stew recipe is made beefier with beef chunks but it still has the same savory tomato sauce, 
			cubes of potatoes and carrots, and sweetness from the pickle relish. 
			You'll love that this meatier version is made better with the simple swap from pork to beef.
